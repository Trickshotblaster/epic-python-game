# epic-python-game
Epic game made in python with pygame

To use:
Clone the repository in the ide of your choice (tested with pycharm, not sure about VSCode yet), make sure you have pygame installed, and you should be able to run the game!
It's not much right now, but I'm thinking of making it into some kind of platformer.

Feel free to contribute any changes you want to make!
