<h1>Contributing</h1>
All contributions are welcome, whether you want to change code or assets like images. If you want changes to show up in the exe version of the game, you need to open up a terminal at the location of the project, then 

`cd pygameGame` 

to open the pygameGame folder. Then, make sure you have PyInstaller installed, and run

`python -m PyInstaller --onefile game.py` 

to convert the game into an exe that will show up in the dist folder.
